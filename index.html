        <p>
          Chess is an abstract strategy board game for two players which
          involves no hidden information and no elements of chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th
          century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of
          the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular
          games, with millions of players worldwide.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Rules">
        <header><h2>Rules</h2></header>
        <p>
          The rules of chess are published by FIDE (Fédération Internationale
          des Échecs; "International Chess Federation"), chess's world governing
          body, in its Handbook. Rules published by national governing bodies,
          or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc.,
          may differ in some details. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in
          2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is played on a square game board called a chessboard containing 64
          squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as "White"
          and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two
          rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns; each type of piece
          has a different pattern of movement. An enemy piece may be "captured"
          (removed from the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it
          occupies; the object of the game is to "checkmate" (threaten with
          inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a
          game can end in a draw.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start the game, White's pieces are placed on the first rank in the
          following order, from left to right: rook, knight, bishop, queen,
          king, bishop, knight, rook. Pawns are placed on each square of the
          second rank. Black's position mirrors White's, with equivalent pieces
          on every file. The board is oriented so that the right-hand corner
          nearest each player is a light square; as a result the white queen
          always starts on a light square, while the black queen starts on a
          dark square. This may be remembered by the phrases "white on the
          right" and "queen on her color".
        </p>
        <p>
          White moves first, after which players alternate turns. One piece is
          moved per turn (except when castling, during which two pieces are
          moved). In the diagrams, dots mark the squares to which each type of
          piece can move if unoccupied by friendly pieces and there are no
          intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps
          over any intervening pieces). With the sole exception of en passant, a
          piece captures an enemy piece by moving to the square it occupies,
          removing it from play and taking its place. The pawn is the only piece
          that does not capture the way it moves, and it is the only piece that
          moves and captures in only one direction (forwards from the player's
          perspective). A piece is said to control empty squares on which it
          could capture, attack squares with enemy pieces it could capture, and
          defend squares with pieces of the same color on which it could
          recapture. Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even
          when having to move is detrimental.

        <header><h2>Pieces and movements</h2></header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <em>king</em> moves one square in any direction. There is also a special
            move called <a href="#Castle">castling</a> which moves the king and a rook. The king is
            the most valuable piece. It is illegal to play any move that puts
            one's king under attack by an opponent piece. A move that attacks
            the king must be parried immediately; if this cannot be done, the
            game is lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>rook</em> can move any number of squares along a rank or file. A rook
            is involved in the king's <a href="#Castle">castling move</a>.
          </li>
          <li>A <em>bishop</em> can move any number of squares diagonally.</li>
          <li>
            A <em>queen</em> combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any
            number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>knight</em> moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the
            same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two
            squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares
            horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only
            piece that can leap over other pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>pawn</em> can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in
            front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can optionally
            advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are
            unoccupied. A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on
            a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square. It cannot
            capture a piece while advancing along the same
            file, nor can it move to either square diagonally in front without
            capturing. Pawns have two <a href="#Special_moves">special moves</a>: the <a href="#En_passant">en passant capture</a> and

        <h3 id="Strategy">Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Chess strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and
          with setting up goals and long-term plans for future play. During the
          evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as
          <a href="#Material_value">the value of the pieces on the board</a>, control of the center and
          centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of
          key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files,
          and dark or light squares).
        </p>
        <p>
          The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total
          <a href="#Material_value">value of pieces of both sides</a>. The point values used for this purpose
          are based on experience; usually, pawns are considered worth one
          point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five
          points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight
          being known as the exchange), and queens about nine points. The king
          is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, since its
          checkmate loses the game, but is still capable as a fighting piece; in
          the endgame, the king is generally more powerful than a bishop or
          knight but less powerful than a rook. These basic values are then
          modified by other factors like position of the piece (e.g. advanced
          pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares),
          coordination between pieces (e.g. a pair of bishops usually coordinate
          better than a bishop and a knight), or the type of position (e.g.
          knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while
          bishops are more powerful in open positions).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn
          structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton): the configuration of
          pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the
          pieces, pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the
          strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in pawn structure include
          isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and holes; once created, they are
          often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these
          weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for
          example, by the possibility of developing an attack).
        </p>
        <h3 id="Tactics">Tactics</h3>
        <p>
          In chess, tactics generally refer to short-term maneuvers – so
          short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player.
          The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability. In
          quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep
          calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in
          positions with a limited number of forced variations, strong players
          can calculate long sequences of moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theoreticians describe many <a href="#Tactical_patterns">elementary tactical methods</a> and typical
          maneuvers, for example: <a href="#Pin">pins</a>, <a href="#Fork">forks</a>, <a href="#Skewer">skewers</a>, <a href="#Battery">batteries</a>, <a href="#Discovered_attack">
            discovered attacks </a> (especially discovered checks), <a href="#Zwischenzug">zwischenzugs</a>, deflections,
          decoys, <a href="#Sacrifice">sacrifices</a>, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.
          Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions threats, exchanges of
          material, and double attacks can be combined into longer sequences of
          tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one
          or both players. A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and
          usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination. Brilliant
          combinations such as those in the Immortal Game are considered
          beautiful and are admired by chess lovers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' tactical
          skills, is a position where a combination is available and the
          challenge is to find it. Such positions are usually taken from actual
          games or from analysis of actual games. Solutions usually result in
          checkmate, decisive advantage, or successful defense. Tactical
          exercises are commonly found in instructional books, chess magazines,
          newspaper chess columns, and internet chess sites.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Phases">Phases</h3>
        <p>
          Chess theory divides chess games into three phases with different sets
          of strategies: the opening, the middlegame, and lastly the endgame.
          There is no universally accepted way to delineate the three phases of
          the game; the middlegame is typically considered to have begun after
          10–20 moves, and the endgame when only a few pieces remain.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Opening">Opening</h4>
        <p>
          Competitive players typically learn, memorize, and play
          well-documented sequences of opening moves. The most common starting
          moves for White are 1.e4 and 1.d4, which usually lead to substantially
          different types of positions, and Black has multiple viable responses
          to both.
        </p>
        <p>The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Development</em>: moving pieces (particularly bishops and knights)
            forward to squares on which they are useful (defending, attacking,
            and controlling important squares) and/or have the potential to take
            part in future plans and ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Control of the center</em>: control of the central squares allows pieces
            to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can
            inhibit the mobility of the opponent's pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>King safety</em>: typically secured by castling; incorrectly timed
            castling can be wasteful or even harmful, however.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Pawn structure</em>: players strive to avoid the creation of pawn
            weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and to force
            such weaknesses in the opponent's position.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="Middlegame">Middlegame</h4>
        <p>
          The middlegame is the part of the game that starts after the opening.
          Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based
          on the features of the position, and at the same time take into
          account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is
          the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series
          of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame
          combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's
          king.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and
          how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. simplify).
          Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory
          only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an
          appropriate way to achieve an ending.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Endgame">Endgame</h4>
        <p>
          The endgame (also end game or ending) is the stage of the game when
          there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic
          differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pawns become more important. Endgames often revolve around endeavors
              to promote a pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank.
            </li>
            <li>
              The king,which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame, emerges
              as a strong piece in the endgame. It is often used to protect its own
              pawns, attack enemy pawns, and hinder moves of the opponent's king.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang">Zugzwang</a>, a situation in which the player who is to move is forced to
              incur a disadvantage, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in
              other stages of the game.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Ressources">

        <h3 id="Special_moves">Special moves</h3>
        <h4 id="Castle">Castle</h4>
        <p>
          Kings can castle once per game. Castling consists of moving the king
          two squares toward either rook of the same color, and then placing the
          rook on the square that the king crossed.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Promotion">Promotion</h4>
        <p>
          A pawn that advances all the way to the opposite side of the board
          (the opposing player's first rank) is promoted to another piece of
          that player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same
          color. The pawn is immediately (before the opposing player's next
          move) replaced by the new piece.
        </p>
        <h4 id="En_passant">En passant</h4>
        <p>
          When a pawn uses its initial-move option to advance two squares
          instead of one, and in so doing passes over a square that is attacked
          by an enemy pawn. That enemy pawn, which would have been able to
          capture the moving pawn had it advanced only one square, is entitled
          to capture the moving pawn "in passing" as if it had advanced only one
          square. The capturing pawn moves into the empty square over which the
          moving pawn moved, and the moving pawn is removed from the board. The
          option to capture en passant must be exercised on the move immediately
          following the double-square pawn advance, or it is lost and may not be
          made later.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Material_value">Material value</h3>
        <p>
          Material is a way to measure the strenght of a position. Each piece is
          assigned a value and the player with more material value overall is
          considered in a winning position. It can also help to decide wether an
          exchange of pieces or a sacrifice is worth pursuing. The convention
          around the value of each piece is defined as :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pawn</strong>: 1pt.</li>
          <li><strong>Knight</strong>: 3pt.</li>
          <li><strong>Bishop</strong>: 3pt.</li>
          <li><strong>Rook</strong>: 5pt.</li>
          <li><strong>Queen</strong>: 9pt.</li>
          <li><strong>King</strong>: Invaluable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="Tactical_patterns">Tactical patterns</h3>
        <h4 id="Battery">Battery</h4>
        <p>
          A formation that consists of two or more pieces on the same rank,
          file, or diagonal. It is a tactic involved in planning a series of
          captures to remove the protection of the opponent's king, or to simply
          gain in the exchanges.

        <h4 id="Fork">Fork</h4>
        <p>
          A tactic in which a piece attacks multiple enemy pieces
          simultaneously. The attacker usually aims to capture one of the forked
          pieces. The defender often cannot counter every threat. A fork is most
          effective when it is forcing, such as when the king is put in check. A
          fork is a type of double attack.

        <h4 id="Pin">Pin</h4>
        <p>
          A tactic in which a defending piece cannot move out of an attacking
          piece's line of attack without exposing a more valuable defending
          piece. Moving the attacking piece to effect the pin is called pinning;
          the defending piece restricted by the pin is described as pinned. Only
          a piece that can move any number of squares along a horizontal,
          vertical, or diagonal line can pin.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Skewer">Skewer</h4>
        <p>
          An attack upon two pieces in a line similar to a pin. A skewer is the
          opposite of a pin; the difference is that in a skewer, the more
          valuable piece is the one under direct attack and the less valuable
          piece is behind it.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Discovered_attack">Discovered attack</h4>
        <p>
          A direct attack revealed when one piece moves out of the way of
          another. Discovered attacks can be extremely powerful, as the piece
          moved can make a threat independently of the piece it reveals.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Zwischenzug">Zwischenzug</h4>
        <p>
          A chess tactic in which a player, instead of playing the expected
          move, first interposes another move posing an immediate threat that
          the opponent must answer, and only then plays the expected move. It is
          a move that has a high degree of "initiative".
        </p>
        <h4 id="Sacrifice">Sacrifice</h4>
        <p>
          A move that gives up a piece with the objective of gaining tactical or
          positional compensation in other forms. A sacrifice could also be a
          deliberate exchange of a chess piece of higher value for an opponent's
          piece of lower value. Any chess piece except the king may be
          sacrificed.
